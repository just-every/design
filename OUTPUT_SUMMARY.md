# Design Agent Output Summary

## Test Results Location

All test outputs are saved in `.output/` directory. Here are the key directories:

### 1. Simple Search Test Results
**Location:** `.output/simple-search-test/`
- `results.html` - Visual preview of search results (open in browser)
- `all_results.json` - Raw JSON data of all search results

### 2. Full Design Agent Test
**Location:** `.output/test-output-2025-07-04-521930/`
- `grids/` - Contains numbered grid images showing design selections:
  - `test_round1_group1_*.png` - First round, first group (9 designs)
  - `test_round1_group2_*.png` - First round, second group (7 designs)
  - `test_round2_group1_*.png` - Second round (8 selected designs)
- `selected_designs.json` - Final selected designs (currently empty due to a bug)

### 3. Debug Outputs
- `.output/debug-search/` - Debug grids from search testing
- `.output/debug-dribbble/` - Dribbble-specific debug files
- `.output/screenshots/` - Individual screenshots taken during searches

## Key Findings

1. **Search Engines Working:**
   - ✅ Dribbble - Returning high-quality logo designs
   - ✅ Behance - Returning professional branding projects
   - ✅ Pinterest - Working with screenshots
   - ✅ Envato - Working with screenshots
   - ✅ Awwwards - Working with curated designs

2. **Grid Creation Working:**
   - Successfully creates numbered grids for visual selection
   - Grids show 3x3 layout with numbered designs
   - High-quality thumbnails from search results

3. **Vision Selection Working:**
   - AI models can analyze grids and select best designs
   - Provides reasoning for each selection
   - Works with both Claude and GPT-4 vision models

4. **Issue Found:**
   - Multi-round selection in `smart_design_raw` has a bug where final results are empty
   - Individual components work correctly
   - The mapping between rounds needs fixing

## How to View Results

1. **Visual HTML Preview:**
   ```bash
   open .output/simple-search-test/results.html
   ```

2. **View Grid Images:**
   ```bash
   open .output/test-output-2025-07-04-521930/grids/
   ```

3. **Raw JSON Data:**
   ```bash
   cat .output/simple-search-test/all_results.json | jq
   ```

## Next Steps

To use the design agent effectively:

1. Use `design_search()` for simple searches from specific engines
2. Use `smart_design_raw()` for multi-engine searches with AI selection (needs bug fix)
3. All outputs are saved to `DESIGN_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable location
4. Grid images are saved in `grids/` subdirectory
5. Screenshots are saved in `screenshots/` subdirectory
